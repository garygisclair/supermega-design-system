# Supermega Design System

A 70+ component React design system with 200+ design tokens, built using a Figma-to-React pipeline powered by Claude Code and the Figma MCP. No scripts, no intermediate specs — just direct Figma-to-code translation.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- npm v9 or higher

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/garygisclair/supermega-design-system.git
cd supermega-design-system

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/supermega-design-system/](http://localhost:5173/supermega-design-system/) in your browser.

## What's inside

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **UI Library** | Browse 70+ components, 200+ design tokens, and patterns |
| **Playground** | Build and prototype new Portal experiences using the component library |
| **About** | The goal, how we built it, and the pipeline that powers it |

## How it was built

This project uses a Figma-to-React pipeline driven entirely by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and the [Figma MCP](https://www.figma.com/developers/mcp):

1. **Design tokens** extracted from Figma via `get_variable_defs` → `src/tokens.css`
2. **Components** implemented from `get_design_context` → TSX + CSS, no scripts or intermediate specs
3. **Zero magic numbers** — all colors, spacing, typography, and radii reference CSS custom properties

## Using the Playground

1. Open the Playground from the welcome screen
2. Copy the sample prompt and paste it into your AI assistant (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
3. Replace `[describe your UI here]` with what you want to build
4. Edit `src/playground.tsx` — the browser hot-reloads instantly

All components live in `src/components/`. Design tokens are in `src/tokens.css`.

## Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [vite-plugin-svgr](https://github.com/pd4d10/vite-plugin-svgr) for SVG icons
- Plain CSS with design tokens — no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS
- [Figma MCP](https://www.figma.com/developers/mcp) + [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) as the build pipeline

## Other commands

```bash
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

## Troubleshooting

**`npm install` errors or `npm run dev` fails with "vite: not found"**

This usually means your npm version is too old. The repo requires **npm v9+**:

```bash
node --version   # should be v18 or higher
npm --version    # should be v9 or higher

# Upgrade npm if needed:
npm install -g npm@latest
```

Then delete any partial install and start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

Do **not** run `npm audit fix --force` — it can silently upgrade packages to incompatible major versions and break the build.
